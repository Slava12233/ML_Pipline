## Getting Started

To begin implementing the tasks, start with Phase 1 to set up the local development environment and validate the core functionality before moving to GCP.

### Initial Steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Set up GCP SDK and authentication
4. Configure your local environment
5. Run the local pipeline to validate functionality

### GCP Preparation:

1. Create GCP project or ensure access to existing project
2. Enable required APIs in GCP console
3. Set up service account with appropriate permissions
4. Configure local application to authenticate with GCP
