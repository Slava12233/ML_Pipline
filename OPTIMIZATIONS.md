# Codebase Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations and improvements made to the codebase to enhance maintainability, reduce duplication, and improve code organization.

## 1. Unified Evaluation Module

### Problem
The codebase contained two nearly identical evaluation scripts (`evaluate_pdf.py` and `evaluate_pdf_peft.py`) that shared significant code duplication. The first handled regular model evaluation while the second added PEFT/LoRA adaptation, but they shared the same core functionality.

### Solution
- Created a unified `src/evaluation/model_evaluator.py` module with configurable options for using standard models or PEFT-adapted models
- Implemented a single API that supports both use cases
- Added proper type hints and documentation
- Created a new CLI script (`scripts/evaluate_model.py`) to replace both original scripts

### Benefits
- Reduced code duplication by ~60%
- Improved maintainability by centralizing evaluation logic
- Enhanced extensibility for adding new model types
- Proper type checking and documentation

## 2. Enhanced Configuration System

### Problem
The codebase had multiple complete configuration files with redundant information, making it difficult to maintain consistency across environments and causing confusion about which config file to use.

### Solution
- Implemented a hierarchical configuration system using a base config file and environment-specific overrides
- Created a modular configuration system with Pydantic models for type safety
- Added support for environment-specific configuration using the `environment` parameter
- Implemented automatic discovery of environment-specific configs (`local_config.yaml`, `vertex_config.yaml`, etc.)
- Added support for config overrides via environment variables and command line

### Benefits
- Reduced configuration duplication
- Improved type safety with Pydantic models
- Made environment-specific overrides clear and maintainable
- Enhanced documentation of configuration values

## 3. Fixed PDF Processing Module

### Problem
The PDF processing module had an error where it attempted to import a non-existent module (`from pdf_processing import metadata`), causing the pipeline to fail when extracting metadata.

### Solution
- Rewritten the PDF extraction module to be self-contained
- Integrated metadata extraction directly into the text extraction functions
- Created proper `__init__.py` files for module organization
- Added comprehensive error handling

### Benefits
- Fixed the "No module named 'pdf_processing'" error
- Improved error reporting and handling
- Made the code more modular and maintainable

## 4. Consolidated Main Script

### Problem
The main script (`finetune_slava_cv.py`) contained hardcoded paths and duplicated functionality across multiple scripts.

### Solution
- Updated the script to use our new consolidated modules
- Used Path objects consistently for better cross-platform compatibility
- Added environment selection via command line
- Improved PDF processing and evaluation integration

### Benefits
- More maintainable and consistent codebase
- Better error handling and reporting
- Improved cross-platform compatibility

## 5. Cleaned Up Unused Files

### Problem
The codebase contained duplicate scripts and files that were no longer being used, causing confusion and maintenance overhead.

### Solution
- Consolidated functionality into a smaller number of well-organized modules
- Created a new unified CLI script to replace duplicated scripts
- Ensured consistent module organization with proper imports

### Benefits
- Cleaner codebase with fewer files to maintain
- More intuitive organization
- Easier onboarding for new developers

## How to Use the New System

### Running the Pipeline

The main pipeline script now supports environment-specific configuration:

```bash
python scripts/finetune_slava_cv.py --config config/config.yaml --env local
```

The `--env` parameter can be set to:
- `local` - For local development environments
- `vertex` - For Vertex AI environments
- `production` - For production environments

### Evaluating Models

Use the new unified evaluation script to evaluate models on PDFs:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py --pdf-path data/pdfs/example.pdf --model-name gpt2 --use-standard --use-peft
```

Options:
- `--use-standard` - Evaluate using the standard model
- `--use-peft` - Evaluate using a PEFT-adapted model
- `--output-dir` - Directory to save evaluation results
- `--config-path` - Configuration file path
- `--env` - Environment (local, vertex, production)

### Configuration System

The new configuration system uses a hierarchical approach:

1. Base configuration in `config/config.yaml`
2. Environment-specific overrides in:
   - `config/local_config.yaml`
   - `config/vertex_config.yaml`
   - `config/production_config.yaml`

To use a specific environment:

```python
from src.utils.config import get_config

# Load config with environment
config = get_config(config_path="config/config.yaml", env="production")

# Access configuration values with type safety
project_id = config.gcp.project_id
model_name = config.fine_tuning.model
```

The environment can also be set via the `PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

## Next Steps

1. **Create Unit Tests** - Develop comprehensive tests for the new modules
2. **Create API Documentation** - Generate API documentation using a tool like Sphinx
3. **Add Logging Configuration** - Implement configurable logging levels and formats
4. **Container Support** - Add Docker support for consistent environments
